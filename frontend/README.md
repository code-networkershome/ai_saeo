# 🎨 SAEO.ai Frontend: Professional Data Visualization

The SAEO.ai frontend is a premium React dashboard built to visualize the outputs of our **12-tool backend ecosystem**. We move beyond "AI scores" to provide actionable, interactive tables and charts powered by real-world data sources.

## 💎 Visualizing the 12-Tool Ecosystem

The UI has been specifically engineered to highlight the difference between "Real Data" and "AI Estimates."

### 🔗 1. Google Search Console & Analytics Integration
- **Connection Interceptor**: A premium modal that detects GSC status. It gives you the "Choice of Truth": use real Google data or fall back to high-fidelity AI estimations.
- **Verification Badges**: Look for the **"GSC Verified"** badges across the Analytics Dashboard, indicating that the impressions and clicks on your screen are 100% real.

### 🏆 2. Global Authority & Link-Graph Badges
- **Powered by OpenPageRank & CommonCrawl**: Instead of a generic "Power Score," we display real **Domain Authority** and **Referring Domain** counts.
- **Interactive Distribution Charts**: Visualize your backlink profile across different authority ranges (0-100) using high-density Recharts visualizations.

### 🛡️ 3. The "Deep Audit" UI
- **SSL Labs & W3C Validator**: Technical audits now display official grades (e.g., "SSL Grade: A+") and raw HTML error counts.
- **Glassmorphism Metrics**: All technical data is presented in a premium "Glass" layout with backdrop blurs, ensuring maximum readability without aesthetic clutter.

### 🌎 4. Real-Time SERP Competition
- **DuckDuckGo Global Index**: Our Keyword Tools don't just show scores; they show the **Live Top 10 Search Index**.
- **Interactive Rows**: Click any result to visit the ranking competitor or view their "Authority Node" status.

## 🔥 Key Interaction Principles

1. **Agent Streaming**: Data is rendered as it is retrieved from the 12 backend tools. You don't wait for the whole audit; you watch the agents "Stream" their findings live.
2. **Transparency First**: We never hide the data source. Every widget clearly identifies if its data is from **GSC, OpenPageRank, PageSpeed, or AI Estimation.**
3. **Roadmap Export**: One-click printing of the AEO Optimization Roadmap for technical teams and stakeholders.

## 🚦 Getting Started

2. **Launch**: `npm run dev`
